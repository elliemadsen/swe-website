          <p> Brown SWE is committed to community outreach aimed at inspiring future generations to pursue careers in
            engineering. We partner with several other local and Brown organizations to volunteer as mentors to younger
            students. SWE coordinates a math mentorship program for students at the local Met High School. SWE also is
            involved in several yearly events, such as Be an Engineer Day at the Providence Children’s Museum, BRYTE
            Science day, and a Girl Scouts Conference hosted by SWE-NESS. These programs encourage excitement about
            science and engineering in younger students and introduce them to the field of engineering.</p>

      <h4>Community Engagement</h4><br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8">
          <p>Within the Brown community, SWE promotes women in engineering by organizing community-building activities,
            advertising internship and educational opportunities, and forming mentoring relationships between students.
            Annual interactive events include an extreme gingerbread house and edible car competition where students
            apply the laws of physics and engineering mechanics to have their projects withstand our series of tests.
            Additionally, SWE collaborates with other student groups such as Women in Science and Engineering, Lean In,
            and Hack@Brown to give members a wide base of STEM opportunities. A major goal of SWE is to provide
            mentorship to our members. Our mission to provide mentorship and retain women in the engineering program is
            enhanced in other fun, informal settings like mixers, movie nights, and study breaks which we host
            periodically throughout the semester.</p>

      <h4>Professional Development</h4><br>
      <p>Brown SWE hosts a range of professional development events which are open to all members of the Brown
        community. These include career options panels, lectures from distinguished guest speakers, and industry tours.
        Panelists have included engineers at Ximedica, Fuss & O’Neill, Sensata, and the US Navy. Past industry tours
        provide access to local companies such as General Dynamics, Sensata, OnShape, and Dell SecureWorks. Our chapter
        annually sends student leaders to the SWE National and Regional Conferences. The attendees have greatly
        benefited from the conferences by gaining access to networking and job opportunities. Collegiate members of our
        section also build connections through the New England Shoreline Section of SWE (SWE-NESS), our associated
        professional chapter which often provides support for our professional development events as well as mentorship
        for our members.</p>

      <h4>SWE National Conference</h4><br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <p>The Society of Women Engineers Annual Conference is not only the world's largest conference and career fair
            for women in engineering, but also a valuable experience to network, learn, and connect with colleagues.
            Over the past few years many Brown students who have attended the conference have found jobs, internships,
            and made crucial networking connections at this conference. This year, as the conference is virtual, it will
            span two weeks, consisting of various workshops and career fairs to promote professional development and
            well-being.<br>Every year our section of SWE funds students to attend the conference (primarily juniors and
            seniors). This year, we are working on a sliding scale to offset costs on need-based requirements. Based on
            the interest we receive, it may be possible to fund all students. If not, we give priority to funding
            juniors and seniors who are concentrating in engineering.<br>You may read more about the details on the <a

      <h4>Mentorship Program</h4><br>
      <p>We are so excited to bring this new opportunity to engineers at Brown to receive more personalized advising.
        Through this mentorship program, SWE hopes to foster a sense of community among Brown engineers. Sign ups are
        closed for this year, but be on the lookout for Fall 2021 sign ups in October.</p>
