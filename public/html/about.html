              I am a senior studying biomedical engineering at Brown. As
              co-presidents, Lisa and I organize and conduct meetings for the
              group, manage business contact with outside companies, and

              Brown BMES, a head BDW mentor, and a researcher in Dr. Lee’s lab.
              When I am not in Barus & Holley (Brown’s engineering building), my
              life centers around the outdoors. I love hiking, skiing, swimming
              and anything involving heights.

              Hi! I’m Ishani and I’m a junior studying Chemical Engineering and
              Contemplative Studies! I’ve been on the SWEboard for 3 years now
              and it’s honestly been one of my favorite parts of Brown! As the
              D&I Officer, I hope to make SWE a welcoming and supportive place
              for people of all identities! I also am deeply committed to
              confronting anti-Black racism and dismantling white supremacy in
              the systems we all are currently forced to operate within. Know
              you can always come to me if you have any questions, concerns, or
              complaints! I’m always here to listen and learn :) Outside of SWE,
              I’m a Bonner Fellow with the Providence Student Union, a Swearer
              Center Peer Mentor, a member of the Community Corps (HOPE, PAL),
              Active Minds secretary and on Abhinaya and Badmaash Dance
              Companies! In my free time, you can find me reading about
              sustainability/environmental justice, procrasti-cleaning, or
              color-coding my Google calendar!
